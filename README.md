# Overview
This repository contains C++ projects developed for the 'Object-Oriented Programming' class, which I attended during my second semester at AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow.

Each class, I was given one of these exercises with a strict deadline of one hour to complete it. The difficulty gradually increased with each subsequent exercise. 
We were evaluated based on the time it took to finish the task and the quality of our solution.

Overall, this course was quite enjoyable - not as fun as [Computational Geometry](https://github.com/Filip-Rak/Computational_Geometry) will be, but the best so far at the time.

## Contents
Each folder represents a different exercise focused on key concepts of object-oriented programming, such as:
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Classes
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

Each directory contains:
- Source code (`.cpp` file or files)
- Exercise description (`.pdf`)
